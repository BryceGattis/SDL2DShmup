# SDL2DShmup
A basic 2D shoot 'em up style game made with SDL.

This version of the game is very incomplete and only has basic movement logic implemented for the player.

## Controls

Arrow keys: Move Player
Spacebar: Fire

## TODO

- Implement player firing
- Implement enemies
- Implement enemies shooting
- Scoring
- Main Menu

## Dependencies

[SDL 2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2)

## Notes

For the .exe to launch on Windows as is, you need to copy the SDL `SDL2.dll` file to the build folder containing the
`SDLTest.exe` file prior to executing the `.exe`.

## Resources

The game's graphical assets are from the [Kenny Asset Packs](https://kenney.nl/assets). Specifically I'm using:

- [Kenny Space Shooter Extension](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-extension)
